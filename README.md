## NOTES:
* Configuring your guest VM IP address is typically the scope of a provisioner... However, there is a lot of discussions in the issues section on this plugin, so I decided to take advice and put a wiki page.  If you have a solution you would like to share, please write up some details in Markdown and create a Pull Request.

* There are probably 100's of ways to set a static IP address for your guests.  There will be advantages and disadvantages to any solution.  Some will be simple and some will be complex.   Custom scripts tend to be propitiatory to a specific environment or OS.
